    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken tikka is a chicken dish originating in the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal era. The dish is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is packed with flavor, with just enough browned bits on your chicken to keep it interesting, tangy but also rich, with a signature bronze-orange tikka masala color.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>Tikka Masala sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <H3>Steps</H3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the chicken into bite-sized chunks. Combine the cubed chicken with the yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, cumin, garam masala, and paprika and stir until well-coated.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Line a high-sided baking pan or roasting tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place the marinated chicken pieces on bamboo or wooden skewers, then set them over the prepared baking pan, making sure there is space underneath the chicken to help distribute the heat more evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 15 minutes, until slightly dark brown on the edges.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the tikka masala sauce, cooking for another 1-2 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice or alongside naan bread.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
