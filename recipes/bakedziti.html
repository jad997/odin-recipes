    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Easy Baked Ziti is a great Italian casserole recipe for feeding a crowd filled with layers of pasta, sausage, and cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ziti or penne pasta</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage, ground beef, or ground pork</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 to 4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 cups jarred marinara or pasta sauce</li>
            <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>1 heaping cup ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pot of salted water (for every 2 quarts of water, one tablespoon of salt) to a strong boil.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until the pasta is al dente—edible but still a little firm to the bite.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta through a colander. Toss with a little olive oil so the pasta does not stick together while you make the sauce.</li>
            <li>While the water is heating in the previous step, start on the sauce. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>When the oil is shimmering hot, add the bulk sausage or ground meat. Break up any large chunks of sausage as it cooks. Brown well.</li>
            <li>When the meat is mostly browned, add the onions and stir well to combine. Sauté everything until the onions are translucent and beginning to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, rosemary or basil, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Cook 1 minute, then add the tomato sauce and stir well. Bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole pan, then dot the surface with half the ricotta cheese. Ladle a spoonful of sauce into the pasta, stir it well and then add the pasta into the casserole.</li>
            <li>Pour the rest of the sauce over the pasta, dot the remaining ricotta cheese over the pasta, and sprinkle on top both the mozzarella and the Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered in the oven at 350°F until the top is lightly browned and the cheese melted, about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
